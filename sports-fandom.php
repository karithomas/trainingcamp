        <p>The Atlanta Braves have been my favorite team since I was 5 years old.  I became a fan because their Triple-A affiliate played in Richmond from 1966-2008 and we were able to go to those games growing up.</p>

        <p class="sports_team__blurb">The Washington Football team has been my favorite football team since I was very young.  My entire family has rooted for them for as long as I can remember, although some have switched their allegiances over the last few years because the team is never very good.</p>

        <p>The St. Louis Blues have been my favorite hockey team since 2016.  Hockey wasn't a sport that I paid a lot of attention to but we went to St. Louis and the Blues were in the playoffs.  We watched a playoff game at Fox Sports Midwest Live and seeing the energy of a bunch of likeminded fans prompted me to become a fan of the Blues.</p>
