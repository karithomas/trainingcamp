    <p>My name is Kari Thomas and I'm from a small town called Powhatan, VA.  My family moved there when I was 5 years old and I graduated in 2007 from Powhatan High School.    
    Powhatan is a very rural county in Virginia and there wasn't much to do when we were growing up besides play sports.  I played softball from the time I was 4 until I was 27.  I have recently started playing in a golf league on Tuesday nights with a couple of friends at XGolf Richmond.  I really enjoy golfing and hope I can continue to get better at it.
    My favorite MLB stadium that I've been to is Busch Stadium.  I really liked it because there was a lot of things to do within walking distance of the stadium and it's cool to see the Arch behind the field when you're there.</p>
